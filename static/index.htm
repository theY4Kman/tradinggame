        <h1>Trading Game</h1>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> You've got five minutes to make as much money as you can.</p>
        <p>Make money by purchasing items. The price of each item is shown, along with the market value. When you buy an item, it will automatically be put up for sale at its market value. <em>Your profit for each item is the difference between its price and market value.</em></p>
        <p>Be careful, because not all sellers are trustworthy. <em>A seller might not ship your item after you buy it.</em> The Seller Ratings give you an indication of the seller's past history.</p>
<!--
        <p>On the left side of the playing area is the menu. Clicking on each of the categories opens that page. The <em>Buying</em> tab lists all the items you can purchase. The <em>Selling</em> tab displays all the items you've purchased. When you buy an item, the game automatically puts it up for sale at a price it determines. Finally, the <em>Transactions</em> tab lists every action that's occurred in the game.</p>
        <p>Below the navigation, you've got your timer, counting down from five minutes. Below that is the wallet indicator, which displays how much money you have. Under the wallet indicator, notifications will appear when certain actions take place, such as buying or selling an item. You can click on a notification to make it disappear and be redirected to the relevant tab. You can also click the <em>Clear Notifications</em> button at the top of the list to make all the notifications vanish.</p>
        <p>To purchase an item, go to the <em>Buying</em> tab and click on an item. The purchase page will slide down. Click the big <em>Buy</em> button to purchase it. Then you can switch to the <em>Selling</em> tab to view your item up for auction. If someone buys your item, it will disappear from the <em>Selling</em> screen. Look at the notifications or the <em>Transactions</em> tab to see how much the item sold for after the item has disappeared from the <em>Selling</em> tab.</p>-->
